Aviation Lights for Kerbal Space Program

This is a maintainance respository for AviationLights for KSP by BigNose.  During BigNose's absence from the forum, I will maintain the mod on GitHub.

Source code for the MOARdV maintainance releases is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MOARdV/AviationLights).

## CREDITS

From the original AviationLights [forum post](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/16801-105-aviation-lights-v38-16nov15/):

First things first: Big thanks for RPGprayer's "Position/Navigation Lights" AddOn, from which the Aviation Lights originated.

Additional credits go to Deadweasel, Why485, GROOV3ST3R, JDP and J.Random for their great help with this addon.

## INFORMATION

There are two types of standard aviation lights:

**Navigationlights** (often called Positionlights) are a safety feature on every plane bigger than an ultra-light. They indicate the orientation of the plane for other air traffic, so they know in which direction you're going. For that, the international standard of a red light on the left wingtip, a green one on the right and a white on the tail was set.

Example for the correct use in KSP:

But, of course, this is KSP. You can just put them on where it looks cool. :D

**Warninglights** (More commonly reffered to as "Strobe&Beacon") are flashing lights to enhance detection range in bad weather and to warn other air traffic and ground personnel. Beacons are mostly mounted on tip of the vertical tail on smaller planes, or in the middle of the fuselage (top and/or bottom). They're red, bright and flashing to indicate that parts of the airplane (engines) or the airplanes itself are moving or about to be moved.

Strobes are very bright, white, fast blinking lights which are mounted on the wingtips (next to the red/green navlights) and sometimes on the tail (next to the white navlight) on larger planes. They're in fact so bright, that they remain off until the pilot lines up on the runway, so the ground personnel won't get blinded if they stand right next to it.

Due to popular request, I now also included the amber warning light by Deadweasel, which I just adapted to the new file system and values.

## CHANGELOG

8MAY16 - v3.9 (KSP 1.1.x maintainance release - MOARdV)

* Fixed: Works with KSP 1.1.x.
* Changed: Put it on GitHub, added visual studio project files and all that stuff.

16NOV15 - v3.8 (Entry cost and physics - BigNose)

* Added: Lights now have double their normal prize as entry cost in the tech tree
* Changed: Lights are now skipped by the physics engine (performance gain when using them in large numbers)
